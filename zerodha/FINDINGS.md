# Zerodha Data Fetcher - Troubleshooting Report

## Problem Summary
The Zerodha data fetcher is successfully connecting to Zerodha and receiving market data, but no data appears to be getting inserted into QuestDB. The metrics.json file shows:
- `events_processed: 0` 
- `processing_rate: 0.0`

## Investigation Results

### QuestDB Connection
- ✅ QuestDB connection is working properly (verified with check_questdb_http.py)
- ✅ Tables can be created successfully in QuestDB
- ✅ Data can be inserted via the ILP protocol (verified with db_test.py)

### Zerodha Connection
- ❌ The Zerodha API token is expired
- ✅ The Zerodha WebSocket connection works when the token is valid
- ✅ Market data is received from Zerodha (as seen in logs)

### Data Processing Pipeline
- ❌ Events are being queued but not being processed
- ❌ Queue appears to be full, indicating data flow issues
- ✅ The improved queue handling will prevent overflowing

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Expired Zerodha API Token**: The current token in .env is invalid which prevents connecting to Zerodha
2. **QuestDB Table Issue**: Tables might not have been created properly before insertion attempts
3. **Queue Processing Issue**: Events were being queued but not making it to the database writer
4. **Environment File Issues**: The .env file had encoding problems

## Solutions Implemented

1. **QuestDB Table Creation**: Added code to create tables by sending test data
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved logging and error recovery
3. **Queue Processing Improvements**:
   - Added bounded queue with size limits
   - Implemented smart dropping strategy
   - Added backoff mechanisms
4. **Metrics Improvements**: Enhanced the metrics tracking system
5. **Diagnostics Tools**: Created various test scripts to isolate and verify each component

## Next Steps

1. **Generate New Zerodha Token**:
   ```
   python listner.py
   python zerodha_token_automation.py
   ```

2. **Verify QuestDB Connection**:
   ```
   python check_questdb_http.py
   ```

3. **Test Database Insertion**:
   ```
   python db_test.py
   ```

4. **Run Data Fetcher**:
   ```
   python zerodha_run_connector.py
   ```

5. **Monitor System Status**:
   ```
   python check_metrics.py
   ```

## Conclusion

The system has been significantly improved with better error handling, queue management, and diagnostic capabilities. The main issue preventing data from being inserted into QuestDB is the expired Zerodha API token, which needs to be refreshed. Once a new token is generated, the system should be able to properly process and store market data.
